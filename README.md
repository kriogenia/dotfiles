# SotoEstevez dotfiles

Welcome to my new dotfiles. After long time dedicated to scripts and Ansible playbooks I ended up giving an opportunity to [yadm](https://yadm.io/#). It rocks, so... less boilerplate and hardcoding, yay!

## Installing

Just clone the repo with yadm, maybe you get some conflicts. Well, look in the yadm config how to resolve them to get exactly what you want idk. It's not like these dotfiles are intended to be used by others lol.

```sh
yadm clone https://github.com/kriogenia/dotfiles.git
```

## Acknowledgments

- All ASCII art was generated with [jp2a](https://github.com/cslarsen/jp2a)
- A big part of the Hyprland configurations are based on [HyDE](https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE). I heavily reused a lot of their scripts as they're probably more robust than mine.
