# SotoEstevez dotfiles

Welcome to my new dotfiles. After long time dedicated to scripts and Ansible playbooks I ended up giving an opportunity to [yadm](https://yadm.io/#). It rocks, so... less boilerplate and hardcoding, yay!

## Acknowledgments

- All ASCII art was generated with [jp2a](https://github.com/cslarsen/jp2a)
- A big part of the Hyprland configurations are based on [HyDE](https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE). I heavily reused a lot of their scripts as they're probably more robust than mine.
